  ## How it's made:
  <strong>Tech used:</strong> ReactJs & TailwindCSS
  
  I tried my best to utilize React's "props" and "components" features in this project. In order to make the app more dynamic, I created my own product data and implemented to the app so any changes made in product details will update the item. Using TailwindCSS with my custom properties give me more freedom when it comes to styling. 
  
  ## Lessons Learned:
  
  It's always better to have a blueprint of your ideas before starting your actual coding session. Or else my mind likes to take a walk in the ideas jungle.
